# ![](./res/ocead.svg) Ocead's Automated Timestamping

Automatically create trusted timestamps for your commits

---

This software allows you to add timestamps to your contributions to a Git repository via trusted third-party
timestamping services. As specified in [RFC 3161](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3161.html), these timestamps may be
used to prove the existence of data at the time the timestamp was issued. From this, several properties may be derived
for the contributions signed this way:

* Integrity of your contributions
* Proof of ownership of the contributions immediately *before* the commit
* Inferable claim of authorship through timestamping notices additionally to the contributions

All data used and generated by this software is stored in separate Git branches. You may choose freely to publish the
timestamps or keep them private as needed. This software runs entirely client-side.

## Requirements

* [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
* [Curl](https://github.com/curl/curl)
* [Git](https://github.com/git/git)
* [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl)

## Installation

### Automatic

Run the [config.sh](config.sh) script with the path to the local repository you want to install automated timestamping
to:

```shell
./config.sh ~/path/to/repo
```

### Manual

1. Copy the contents of [hooks](hooks) into the `.git/hooks` directory in your local repository.
2. Set the options described in the [options](#options) section at least for the local repository.

> ℹ Note: if the script was installed into `.git/hooks` it is technically not part of the repository
> and will therefore **not** be versioned through commits **nor** sent to remotes through pushs.

> ⚠ Warning: If the repository you wish to install to already uses the `commit-msg` and `post-commit` hooks,
> make sure the scripts of this software are run **not** parallel to other hooked scripts.

## Functionality

This software uses OpenSSL to generate timestamps according to the "Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp
Protocol" specified in [RFC 3161](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3161.html).

The basic flow is as follows:

1. Immediately before committing, a full diff (qualified for use with [git-apply](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-apply))
   of your staged changes / the staged state of the checked out branched is created.
2. This diff is placed into a separate signing branch, corresponding 1:1 to your normal non-signing branches.
3. The diff is then hashed, and a timestamping request for that hash is created in the signing branch for each time
   stamp authority you have configured.
4. These timestamping requests are sent to the timestamping servers and the responses are also be stored in the signing
   branch.
5. The diff, request and response files are then committed to the timestamping branch.
6. Afterwards, your staged contributions are committed to the non-signing branch.

Once automated timestamping is installed and enabled, these steps are automatically executed on each commit you make.

## Configuring time stamp authorities (TSAs)

A time stamp authority is a trusted third party that signs data provided to it using asymmetric keys together with the
timestamp of receiving the data. With this, the TSA confirms that it was sent the signed data at the signed timestamp.
This software utilises the "Time-Stamp Protocol via HTTP" described
in [RFC 3161 Section 3.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3161.html#section-3.4) for requesting timestamps.

### Configuring a new TSA

You can configure an arbitrary number of individual TSA for each repository. To configure a new timestamping server for
a repository where this software is installed to, do the following steps:

1. Check out the branch specified in `ts.branch.prefix` (`sig` by default).<br/>
   Example:
   ```shell
   git checkout sig
   ```

2. In there, navigate to the server specified in `ts.server.directory` (`rfc3161` by default) and create a new
   directory. The name of the directory specifies the domain of the timestamp server.<br/>
   ```shell
   cd rfc3161
   mkdir zeitstempel.dfn.de
   ```
   If the URL of the timestamp server is a resource on a domain, you may name this directory anything and place a file
   named `url` (can be changed via `ts.server.url`) containing the URL inside it instead.

3. Place the public keychain of the timestamp server inside the directory as `cacert.pem` (can be changed
   via `ts.server.certificate`)

The repository should look like this afterwards (provided default options):

```
./
└ rfc3161/
  └ zeitstempel.dfn.de/
    ├ cacert.pem
    └ url
...
```

> ℹ Note: You can find a list of free-to-use timestamping servers
> [here](https://gist.github.com/Manouchehri/fd754e402d98430243455713efada710).

### Finding timestamps

To find a timestamp you created by committing changes, check out the appropriate signing branch (provided default
options) with:

```shell
git checkout "sig/<branch>"
```

You'll find the timestamp files from each configured TSA inside its respective configuration directory (provided default
options) e.g.

```
./
├ .diff <- Full diff of the staged files before committing
└ rfc3161/
  └ zeitstempel.dfn.de/
    ├ cacert.pem
    ├ request.tsq  <- Timestamp request
    ├ response.tsr <- Timestamp
    └ url
...
```

To verify the files against each other you may use these commands (provided default options):

* Show a trusted timestamp's contents:
  ```shell
  cd ./rfc3161/zeitstempel.dfn.de
  openssl ts -reply -in response.tsr -text
  ```

* Verify a timestamp against the request:
  ```shell
  cd ./rfc3161/zeitstempel.dfn.de
  openssl ts -verify -in response.tsr -queryfile request.tsq -CAfile cacert.pem
  ```

* Verify a timestamp against the diff:
  ```shell
  cd ./rfc3161/zeitstempel.dfn.de
  openssl ts -verify -in response.tsr -data ../../.diff -CAfile cacert.pem
  ```

### Updating a TSA configuration

You may want to change the configuration of a TSA if the URL to the server or the keychain of the server change. To do
so (provided default options):

1. Change the associated files/directory on branch `sig`.
2. Commit the changes to `sig`.

Upon committing to the `sig` branch, the timestamps for the changed TSA configurations will be updated for all branches,
that already have a timestamp of the previous version of of the TSA configuration.

### Deleting a TSA configuration

To delete a TSA configuration (provided default options):

1. Delete the associated directory in `rfc3161` on branch `sig`.
2. Commit deleting the directory to `sig`.

## Options

This software is controlled via [git-config](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config). These options all occupy the `ts.`
namespace. They can be set via

```shell
git config <option> "<value>"
```
